# AI-Prompts

A collection of carefully crafted prompts to help you get better results when working with various AI language models (LLMs).

## Purpose

This repository contains optimized prompts for different AI models to help you:
- Get more accurate and consistent responses
- Improve code generation quality
- Achieve better formatting and structure in outputs
- Save time by using tested prompt templates

## Important Note About Using These Prompts

Due to the detailed and specific nature of these prompts, you may occasionally experience:
- LLM timeouts or hanging responses
- Incomplete or truncated outputs
- Error messages from the AI service

This is normal behavior when working with complex prompts. If you encounter these issues:
1. Try breaking your request into smaller chunks
2. Submit the same prompt again (responses may vary)
3. Slightly rephrase the prompt while keeping the core instructions
4. Wait a few moments before retrying if the service seems overwhelmed

## Available Prompts

### GitHub Copilot
- [Python to Node.js Conversion Guide](./Copilot/PythonToNodejs.md) - A comprehensive prompt designed to work with GitHub Copilot's `/edit` command for converting Python code to Node.js format. Use this prompt by copying it into a Copilot chat session followed by your Python code when requesting edits.
